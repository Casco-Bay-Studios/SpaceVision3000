A compact desktop visualizer for various space-related data and imagery using ESP32, APIs, and wifi

This project uses a PCB that was originally for a diferent project, namely https://github.com/supermakesomething/mini-video-player

I wired up a few of them but then decided to try out some of the ESP32's other functions, like WIfi connectivity, and using APIs to collect data from the internet

What does it do?

In a nutshell, SV3K displays data and imagery from various sources. You can click thru the data screens with the NEXT button, and display metadata with the PREV button.
Astronomy PIcture of the Day (NASA)
The next 3 rocket launches worldwide (thespacedevs.com)
The most recent exoplanets discovered (NASA)
The earth from space, single view and multi-view (NASA)
Different views of the sun (NASA)

It also has 2 different screensavers after 10 minutes of inactivity, a blackhole moving thru the void, and a starfall that dissolves the current screen.
