SpaceVision3000


A compact desktop visualizer for various space-related data and imagery using ESP32, APIs, and wifi

This project uses a PCB that was originally for a diferent project, namely https://github.com/supermakesomething/mini-video-player

I wired up a few of them but then decided to try out some of the ESP32's other functions, like WIfi connectivity, and using APIs to collect data from the internet
